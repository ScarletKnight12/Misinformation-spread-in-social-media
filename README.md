## Misinformation-spread-in-social-media
Computational Social Science Project

In this study, we aim to better understand misinformation flows in social networks.

# Research Questions:
Our study takes misinformation as its subject and examines the network structure of misinformation and factual information on social networks in order to understand how misinformation spreads and evolves on social media, as well as what characteristics make misinformation more successful. To achieve this goal, we propose the following research questions:
Is there any significant difference between spread patterns of information based on its veracity?
Do sentiments affect misinformation spread and if they do then what is the correlation between different sentiments and diffusion?
Does the presence of pictures, videos and weblinks contribute to how misinformation is received?
 
# Methods

We have considered tweets from twitter to perform our analysis.
A list of trusted handles is maintained for initial misinformation validation.
If the tweet has cited to any of the sites or handle available in the trusted list then the information is deemed to be a valid information.
If not, sentiment analysis is done. Neutral sentiment indicates valid information, strong sentiments indicate misinformation possibility

T-Test:
The T-Test or the Studentâ€™s test is used to reject a null-hypothesis or not reject it.
We will be using the independent T-Test to determine the diffusion characteristics and draw a comparison, showing that there is a difference in the tweets, likes or comments between the misinformation and the true information.


Correlation:
The correlation graph is made on the various sentiments (positive,negative and neutral) of the users. We see that a positive correlation indicates that information is more likely to be retweeted

GLM:
The General Linear Model (GLM) is a useful framework for comparing how several variables affect different continuous variables.
It is mainly used for model specification. It helps us to arrive at the exact equation that will most accurately summarize the data, in other words it allows us to summarise the research outcomes. 

Network Analysis:
Network Analysis helps us in deep understanding the structure of a relationship in social networks, a structure or process of change in natural phenomenons, or even the analysis of biological systems of organisms.

Diffusion Networks:
Network diffusion captures the underlying mechanism of how events propagate throughout a complex network.
Questions in case of misinformation:
How fast will it spread?
How will the system as a whole react?
What are the hubs in the network that are more connected and therefore more important than others


Cascading network:
We solve the problem of star topology using cascading networks.

Finally we observe our results and analysis (blog file).
